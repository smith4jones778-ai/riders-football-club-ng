  <p>
    The meeting commenced at about 10:30 AM with an opening prayer led by

    The Chairman thereafter addressed members, encouraging everyone to remain

    were raised. The adoption of the minutes was moved by <strong>Mal. Hassan</strong>
    and seconded by <strong>Akeem</strong>, after which the minutes were unanimously adopted.

  <p>
    Under matters arising, the issue of the club’s non-participation in the

    operations, particularly in player development, recruitment, and preparedness, to
    avoid similar challenges in future competitions.
